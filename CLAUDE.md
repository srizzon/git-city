# Git City

3D pixel art city built from real GitHub data. Buildings represent developers: height = contributions, width = repos, lit windows = recent activity.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js App Router, Three.js (instanced rendering), TypeScript
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Realtime)
- **Payments:** Stripe (USD), AbacatePay (BRL/PIX), NOWPayments (crypto)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Project structure

```
src/
  app/              Next.js pages and API routes
  components/       React + Three.js components
  lib/              Core game logic (raids, dailies, XP, items, etc.)
supabase/
  migrations/       Sequential SQL migrations (001_, 002_, ...)
```

## Code conventions

- TypeScript everywhere, no `any`
- `getSupabaseAdmin()` for server-side writes (bypasses RLS)
- `createServerSupabase()` for auth in API routes (cookie-based)
- API routes validate auth, then use admin client for DB operations
- Items use a zone system: crown, roof, aura, faces
- Loadout stored in `developer_customizations` table with `item_id = "loadout"`

## Database

- Migrations in `supabase/migrations/`, numbered sequentially
- Never modify existing migrations, always create new ones
- Run locally with `npx supabase db push`

## Git

- Squash and merge for PRs
- Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`
- Never skip hooks or force push to main
